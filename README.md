# Child Malnutrition Risk Prediction

Malnutrition is one of the leading causes of preventable child illness and mortality, yet many cases go undetected until it is too late for effective intervention. This project explores how data and machine learning can be applied to predict the risk of child malnutrition, providing a way to support earlier and more informed decision-making.  

From a technical perspective, the project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow:  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and feature engineering in Jupyter Notebooks  
- **Model development and evaluation** using supervised learning techniques  
- **Deployment** of the trained model as a Flask web application for real-time predictions  

By integrating data analysis, predictive modeling, and deployment, the project highlights the ability to take a machine learning solution from concept to production-ready application.
