# Child Malnutrition Risk Prediction

Malnutrition is one of the leading causes of preventable child illness and mortality, yet many cases go undetected until it is too late for effective intervention. This project explores how data and machine learning can be applied to predict the risk of child malnutrition, providing a way to support earlier and more informed decision-making.  

From a technical perspective, the project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow:  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and feature engineering in Jupyter Notebooks  
- **Model development and evaluation** using supervised learning techniques  
- **Deployment** of the trained model as a Flask web application for real-time predictions  

By integrating data analysis, predictive modeling, and deployment, the project highlights the ability to take a machine learning solution from concept to production-ready application.  


## Project Motivation / Background  

Child malnutrition remains a critical global health issue, with an estimated **149 million children under five stunted, 45 million wasted, and 37 million overweight in 2022** (WHO, UNICEF, PAHO). Nearly **half of all deaths among children under five** are linked to undernutrition, making early detection and intervention essential.  

We chose this project because it addresses a socially meaningful challenge while allowing us to apply and strengthen  skills in **data science, machine learning, and deployment**. By building a predictive model and deploying it with Flask, we explored how AI/ML solutions can contribute to data-driven decision-making in healthcare.
